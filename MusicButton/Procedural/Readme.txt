don't know why i made this readme file. i just wanted something to put here i guess. if you end up actually reading these readme files that would be kinda cool.

i enjoyed gamecon. it was my first convention i ever went to. but let me tell you, they over charge the fuck out of everything there. like what do you mean a small bag of chips and a regular size coke bottle is $7? that's crazy to me in my opinion. but then again, it's what almost everyone else does whenever they host events.

i also got james to come with me. even though he never got the tickets, the person i went with on my first day didn't wanna go again for the second, so i just gave him the lanyard. it was pretty fun, especially with him around.
